## This course

This course is the natural continuation of the Machine Learning course.
It provides the guidelines for the execution of a Data Mining process and then discusses, with practical examples, the complete pipeline from data to machine learning insights.
 
**Teaching Method(s)**: The theoretical background and the discussion of the principles are introduced in class with presentation of slides and stimulating discussions with the students. The methods are then applied with lab exercises.
